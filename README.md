# Automation of video commercial generation from product URL
Many clients face challenges in creating videos for their informational or promotional needs. To address this, we propose developing a user-friendly tool with the following key features:

### Video Creation from Product URLs:
This feature will enable users to input a product URL (e.g., from e-commerce platforms like Amazon). The system will automatically extract relevant details such as product images, descriptions, and specifications from the provided URL and use them to generate a video.

### AI-Generated Informational Videos:
Leveraging AI, the tool will create high-quality informational or promotional videos. By dynamically incorporating product images and textual details, the system will produce professional-grade videos with minimal user intervention.

### Key Use Case:
#### For instance, when a user provides a product URL, the system will:
1. Extract essential details like the product title, images, description, and specifications.
2. Combine this information with pre-defined templates, animations, and layouts to generate a polished video.
3. This project aims to simplify video creation by eliminating the need for advanced video editing skills. The tool will serve as an innovative solution for clients, streamlining the process of creating high-quality videos and providing an efficient alternative to traditional video-making methods.
